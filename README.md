How it works:

Python bot-assistant knows next commands:
1. "hello" - bot replies to the console "How can I help you?"
2. "add \<Phone contact\> \<Number Tel\>" - bot will add this information to dict of Contacts
3. "change \<Phone contact\> \<Number Tel\>" - bot will change number tel and save to dict of Contacts
4. "phone \<Phone contact\>" - bot will get with \<Phone contact\> information about \<Number Tel\> and will output in cosole
5. "show all" - bot will output all information ( \<Phone contact\> \<Number Tel\>" ) in cosole
6. "good bye", "close", "exit" - with any of these commands, the bot ends its work after outputting "Good bye!" to the console.
